<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Growing up in the vibrant city of Bokaro Steel City, India, I have always been driven 
  by an insatiable curiosity and a passion for learning. Coming from a family of six, I
   learned the values of hard work and perseverance early on. Despite facing academic challenges in school,
    I followed my heart and pursued my love for cooking, which has now become my career</p>

<p>With over eight years of experience as a chef in London, I find immense joy and fulfillment in 
  the fast-paced environment of hotel kitchens. Every dish I create is a reflection of my dedication 
  and creativity. Beyond my professional success, my journey has also been one of personal growth. 
  I have undergone a remarkable transformation, shedding over 70 kilograms through my commitment to fitness
   and well-being.</p>

<p>Driven by a desire to innovate and explore new horizons, I dream of establishing a food tech company 
  that merges my passion for cooking with cutting-edge technology. Currently, I have immersing myself in the
   world of coding, eager to expand my skill set and make my vision a reality. Rooted in my Hindu beliefs,
    I believe in the power of karma and strive to make a positive impact on the world around me. With every 
    dish I create and every challenge I overcome, I have determined to leave my mark on the culinary world and 
    beyond.</p>
